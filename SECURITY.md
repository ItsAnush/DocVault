- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including information on how it can be reproduced, its potential impact, and any mitigating factors.
- **Provide Steps to Reproduce**: If possible, provide clear and concise steps to reproduce the vulnerability so that we can understand and address it effectively.

We are committed to maintaining the security of our application and will take appropriate actions to address any verified vulnerabilities. This may include developing and deploying patches, updates, or fixes to mitigate the vulnerability.
